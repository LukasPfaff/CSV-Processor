# TimeExport
This Program can be used to Transfer Data from .csv files to .txt files. It will use a pattern to retrieve select columns from the .csv file and writing them down in the text file by using the evaluate method on the pattern. 

The pattern is stored in the settings.ini together with the input folder, output folder, a header and the option to skip the first row of the .csv file.
While the other settings can be changed via the GUI the pattern will be on display only to prevent accidental changing. To set your personal pattern you have to save it manually in the settings.ini file.
