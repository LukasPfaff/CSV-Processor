# TimeExport
This short script reads .csv files that get created by a timekeeping system and writes the relevant information into a .txt file. The output file uses a format that can be imported by a software used by tax consultants. Unless you use exactly the same timekeping software and your tax consultant uses the same software this project is useless for you.
